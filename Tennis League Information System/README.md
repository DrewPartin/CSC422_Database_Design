## Database Configuration

This application uses a local MySQL database.

### Setup
1. Copy 'db.properties.example'
2. Rename it to 'db.properties'
3. Update the database url, username, and password

> Note: 'db.properties' is ignored by Git and should NOT be committed.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
